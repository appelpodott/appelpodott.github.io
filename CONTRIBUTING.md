# Contributing to jekyll-theme-redux

## Tips for reporting problems

* If the software does not behave as expected, isolate the troublesome portion
* Explain the expected output, actual output, and steps to reproduce
* Bonus points for screenshots of the expected and actual output
* Issues should be limited to one error described in detail. Issues with vague titles are less likely to be resolved quickly.
* [Open a new issue](https://github.com/laurentboileau/jekyll-theme-redux/issues/new) describing the particular problem.
